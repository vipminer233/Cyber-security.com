        <h2>Essential Online Safety Tips</h2>
        <p>Follow these guidelines to enhance your online security.</p>

        <section class="tip-category">
            <h3>Strong Passwords & Authentication</h3>
            <p>Your password is the first line of defense. Make it strong and enable extra security layers like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use long passwords (at least 12-15 characters).</li>
                <li>Combine uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*).</li>
                <li>Avoid easily guessable information like birthdays, names, or common words.</li>
                <li>Use a unique password for every important account. Don't reuse passwords!</li>
                <li>Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.</li>
                <li>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA or 2FA) whenever available. This requires a second proof of identity (like a code from your phone) besides your password.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recognizing Phishing & Scams</h3>
            <p>Phishing attempts trick you into giving away sensitive information. Be skeptical of unsolicited messages asking for personal data or login credentials.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Be wary of urgent requests or threats demanding immediate action.</li>
                <li>Check the sender's email address carefully for slight misspellings or unusual domains.</li>
                <li>Hover your mouse cursor over links (without clicking!) to see the actual web address they lead to. Make sure it matches the expected site.</li>
                <li>Don't download attachments or click links in unexpected emails or messages.</li>
                <li>If a message seems suspicious, contact the supposed sender through a known, official channel (like their website or phone number) instead of replying directly.</li>
                <li>Watch out for poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or generic greetings like "Dear User".</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Secure Browse Habits</h3>
            <p>Practice safe habits when navigating the internet, especially on public networks.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Look for "https://" (not just "http://") and a padlock icon (ðŸ”’) in your browser's address bar before entering sensitive information on a website. This indicates an encrypted connection.</li>
                <li>Be extremely cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks (cafes, airports, hotels). Avoid logging into bank accounts, email, or other sensitive services unless you use a VPN.</li>
                <li>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for others on the same network to snoop on your activity.</li>
                <li>Keep your web browser and its extensions updated to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Be careful about browser extensions; only install those from trusted developers and review the permissions they request.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Software Updates & Patching</h3>
            <p>Keeping your software up-to-date is crucial for security. Updates often contain patches for security holes that attackers could exploit.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Enable automatic updates for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
                <li>Regularly update your web browsers, security software (antivirus/anti-malware), and other applications (like PDF readers, office suites).</li>
                <li>Remove or uninstall software you no longer use, as outdated programs can become security risks.</li>
            </ul>

         <section class="tip-category">
            <h3>Social Media Safety</h3>
            <p>What you share online can be used against you. Manage your privacy settings and think before you post.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Review and configure the privacy settings on all your social media accounts to limit who can see your posts and personal information.</li>
                <li>Be cautious about sharing personal details like your full birth date, home address, phone number, or information about your daily routines.</li>
                <li>Think twice before accepting friend/follow requests from people you don't know.</li>
                <li>Be aware of quizzes or games that ask for excessive personal information.</li>
                <li>Report suspicious profiles or scam messages.</li>
            </ul>
