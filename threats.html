        <h2>Understanding Common Cyber Threats</h2>
        <p>Awareness is the first step in avoiding online dangers.</p>

        <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Malicious software that encrypts (locks) your files or entire device. Attackers then demand payment (a ransom), usually in cryptocurrency, to provide the decryption key.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> You'll usually see a ransom note on your screen explaining your files are locked and how to pay. You won't be able to open your files.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Keep software updated (especially OS and security software). Back up your important files regularly to an external drive or secure cloud service (and test your backups!). Be extremely cautious with email attachments and links, especially from unknown senders. Use reputable security software.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Phishing</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Attempts to trick you into giving up sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank details) by impersonating a trustworthy entity (like your bank, a social media site, or even your boss) via email, text messages (smishing), or phone calls (vishing).</p>
             <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> Look for urgent requests, threats, generic greetings, poor grammar/spelling, requests for sensitive info, suspicious links (hover to check!), mismatched sender addresses, or unexpected attachments.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Never click suspicious links or download unexpected attachments. Verify requests independently (e.g., call your bank using their official number, not one from the email). Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Use strong, unique passwords. Be skeptical!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Malware (Viruses, Worms, Spyware, Trojans)</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A broad term for any software designed to harm your computer, steal data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt operations. Includes viruses (attach to files), worms (spread across networks), spyware (monitors your activity), trojans (disguise as legitimate software), adware (displays unwanted ads), etc.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> Slow computer performance, unexpected pop-ups, browser homepage changes, crashes, unusual network activity, security software disabled.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Install and maintain reputable antivirus/anti-malware software. Keep your OS and all applications updated. Download software only from trusted sources. Scan downloads before running. Be cautious with email attachments and links. Use strong passwords.</p>
        </section>

         <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The art of manipulating people psychologically to trick them into performing actions (like clicking a bad link, transferring money, giving up a password) or divulging confidential information. Phishing is a type of social engineering.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> Exploits trust, urgency, authority, or curiosity. May involve impersonation, baiting (offering something enticing), or pretexting (creating a believable scenario).</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Be skeptical of unsolicited requests, especially those asking for sensitive info or immediate action. Verify identities through separate channels. Don't overshare personal information online. Think before you click or act.</p>
        </section>

         <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> When someone steals your personal information (like your name, Social Security number, credit card details) to impersonate you, typically for financial gain.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> Unexplained bank withdrawals or credit card charges, receiving bills for accounts you didn't open, calls from debt collectors about unknown debts, denial of credit unexpectedly.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Protect your personal information (shred documents, secure online accounts with strong passwords and MFA). Monitor your bank and credit card statements regularly. Be cautious about sharing sensitive data. Check your credit reports periodically.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="threat-profile">
            <h3>Deepfakes & Disinformation</h3>
             <p><strong>What it is:</strong> AI-generated fake videos or audio recordings that make it appear someone said or did something they didn't. Disinformation is intentionally false or misleading information spread to deceive.</p>
             <p><strong>How to Recognize:</strong> Look for unnatural facial movements, blinking patterns, or lip-syncing in videos. Check the source of information. Be skeptical of sensational or emotionally charged content. Cross-reference information with reputable sources.</p>
             <p><strong>How to Avoid:</strong> Develop critical thinking skills. Question the source and motivation behind information. Look for corroborating evidence from trusted news outlets or fact-checking websites before believing or sharing.</p>

        <section id="social-engineering">
            <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
            <p>Social engineering attacks manipulate people into giving up confidential information or performing actions. They rely on psychological tricks rather than technical exploits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Using deceptive emails, messages, or websites (often spoofing legitimate organizations) to trick users into revealing login credentials, financial details, or other sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted phishing attacks personalized to the victim using gathered information.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</strong> Phishing conducted over phone calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Smishing (SMS Phishing):</strong> Phishing conducted via text messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Luring victims with enticing offers (e.g., free downloads, attractive ads) that lead to malware infection or information theft.</li>
                <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> Creating a believable scenario (pretext) to gain trust and extract information (e.g., pretending to be IT support).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Be skeptical of unsolicited communications, verify identities independently, avoid clicking suspicious links/attachments, and don't share sensitive information based solely on an email or call.</p>
        </section>

         <section id="vulnerabilities">
             <h3>Software & System Vulnerabilities</h3>
             <p>Attackers exploit weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in software, operating systems, or hardware (like edge devices).</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Unpatched Software:</strong> Failing to apply security updates leaves known holes open for attack.</li>
                 <li><strong>Misconfigurations:</strong> Incorrect security settings on systems, devices (like printers), or cloud services can create entry points.</li>
                 <li><strong>Zero-Day Exploits:</strong> Attacks targeting vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor or haven't been patched yet.</li>
