        <h2>Recognizing and Avoiding Phone Scams</h2>
        <p>Phone scams (including voice calls, robocalls, and scam text messages) are common tactics used by criminals to steal your money or personal information. Being aware of their methods is key to protecting yourself.</p>

        <section id="common-tactics">
            <h3>Common Scam Call Tactics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Callers pretend to be from legitimate organizations like your bank, a government agency (e.g., Social Security Administration, IRS, VA, Police), a utility company, or a tech support company.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgency and Threats:</strong> Scammers create a sense of panic, claiming your account is compromised, you owe money, there's a problem with your Social Security number, or you'll be arrested if you don't act immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Requests for Personal Information:</strong> They ask for sensitive data like your Social Security number, bank account details, credit card numbers, PINs, passwords, or verification codes. Remember, legitimate organizations rarely ask for this over an unsolicited call.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Payment Methods:</strong> Scammers often demand payment via unusual methods like gift cards, pre-paid debit cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency because these are harder to trace and recover.</li>
                <li><strong>Robocalls:</strong> Automated calls delivering pre-recorded messages, often illegal unless you've given prior consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</strong> Using voice calls to trick you into revealing information.</li>
                <li><strong>Smishing (SMS Phishing):</strong> Using text messages with malicious links or requests for information. Do not click links in suspicious texts.</li>
                <li><strong>Caller ID Spoofing:</strong> Scammers can fake the caller ID to make the call appear to come from a legitimate number (like your bank or a government agency). Do not rely solely on caller ID.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't Trust Unsolicited Calls/Texts:</strong> Be immediately suspicious of unexpected calls or messages asking for money or personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Hang Up:</strong> If you suspect a scam, feel pressured, or the caller is suspicious, just hang up the phone.</li>
                <li><strong>Never Share Personal/Financial Info:</strong> Do not provide sensitive data like SSN, bank details, passwords, or PINs over the phone unless *you* initiated the call to a known, verified number.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify Independently:</strong> If a caller claims to be from a company or agency, hang up. Find the organization's official phone number (from their website or a bill) and call them directly to verify the situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Resist Pressure:</strong> Legitimate organizations won't pressure you into immediate action or payment, especially using threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Wary of Unusual Payment Methods:</strong> Reject requests for payment via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Call Blocking:</strong> Utilize call-blocking features on your phone or install call-blocking apps. Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry (or your country's equivalent), although this may not stop all illegal calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Screen Calls:</strong> Use caller ID (with caution due to spoofing) and let unknown numbers go to voicemail or an answerphone.</li>
                 <li><strong>Report Scams:</strong> Report scam calls and texts to relevant authorities (e.g., FTC in the US, Action Fraud in the UK, Scamwatch in Australia). Forward scam texts to 7726 (in the US/UK).</li>
